 <p>I am so excited to share that I tried this recipe and for the first time in a long time it all came out perfectly and my family even complimented my cooking (which rarely happens), so I want to thank you Zinhle. I rate this dish a 10/10 &#129321;! <br /> -Xoli M </p>

 <p>I was very hesitant to try to cook after I almost burned the house down the last time and I am here to say that did not happen this time, thank goodness &#129315;. I actually did much better this time and I am sure that with time, I will definitely become a pro. Thank you Zee! <br /> -Sammy</p>

 <p>I think I have found my people, the girlies? I'm all about them! They have saved my reputation at the in-laws, I had already noticed some talk going around but after I cooked last Sunday, my mother-in-law could not stop complimenting me and the shift in the atmosphere was undeniable. It is nice at home now, everyone is happy, love is in the air! I'm never letting Zinhle's Kitchen go, are you kidding me &#129321;! <br /> -Jessy J</p>
