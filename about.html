  <h3 class="about-h3">Zinhle's Kitchen </h3>
  <p>Zinhle's Kitchen is all about a girl who is teaching herself how to cook by experimenting with different recipes so that her family will think that she is the greatest cook they have ever met.</p>
  <p>This is done by firstly creating a safe space for my community to fail and try again because really that is what is going to happen until of course we try and get it right. ZK's is dedicated to provide it's members with simple,easy-to-follow recipes specifically designed to not intimidate people who are trying to learn how to cook. The goal is to leave them motivated to want to try another dish.</p>
  <p>So if you are just a girl like myself who does not have a clue on where to start, you have found your people! Look no further girlie, we've got you. You can go ahead and contact us via whichever method you're comfortable with and we will be in touch!</p>
  <p>Happy cooking &#128522;!</p>
